EMOTEHUB ADDON - INSTALLATION GUIDE
===================================

INSTALLATION STEPS:
==================

1. EXTRACT THE ADDON
   - Place the entire "EmoteHub" folder in your WoW addons directory:
   - Path: World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\EmoteHub

2. VERIFY FILE STRUCTURE
   Your EmoteHub folder should contain:
   - EmoteHub.toc
   - EmoteHub.lua

   - README.md
   - INSTALL.txt (this file)
   - Textures\ (folder for your custom TGA images)


4. LAUNCH WORLD OF WARCRAFT
   - Start WoW normally
   - At character selection, click "AddOns" button
   - Find "EmoteHub" in the list and ensure it's CHECKED
   - Click "Okay" and log in to your character

5. FIRST USE
   - EmoteHub will appear in the center of your screen
   - Left-click and drag to move it anywhere
   - Use /emotehub or /eh to toggle visibility

COMMANDS:
=========
/emotehub        - Toggle EmoteHub on/off
/eh              - Same as above (short version)
/emotehub show   - Show EmoteHub
/emotehub hide   - Hide EmoteHub
/emotehub reset  - Reset position to center screen


TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

PROBLEM: Addon doesn't appear in AddOns list
SOLUTION:
- Check folder name is exactly "EmoteHub"
- Verify EmoteHub.toc file exists
- Restart WoW completely

PROBLEM: EmoteHub doesn't show after login
SOLUTION:
- Type /emotehub show in chat
- Check if addon is enabled in AddOns menu
- Try /reload to restart UI


PROBLEM: Buttons don't work when clicked
SOLUTION:
- This is normal - buttons work via standard action handlers
- Make sure you're not in combat when testing
- Try right-click if left-click doesn't work

PROBLEM: EmoteHub disappeared
SOLUTION:
- Type /emotehub show
- If that doesn't work, try /emotehub reset

SUPPORT:
========
For additional help:
- Read the README.md file for detailed information
- Check WoW addon communities and forums
- Verify your WoW version matches the addon (retail/classic)

CUSTOMIZATION:
==============
Advanced users can modify EmoteHub.lua to change which emotes appear on buttons, but this requires Lua knowledge.

Always backup your changes before modifying files!
