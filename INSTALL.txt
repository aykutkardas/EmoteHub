TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

PROBLEM: Addon doesn't appear in AddOns list
SOLUTION:
- Check folder name is exactly "EmoteBar"

- Restart WoW completely

PROBLEM: EmoteBar doesn't show after login
SOLUTION:
- Type /emotebar show in chat
- Check if addon is enabled in AddOns menu
- Try /reload to restart UI
